## Description
<strong>Star-aligned</strong> uses the constellation behind the Sun at 12:00 UTC in the current year on your month and day, which can include Ophiuchus.

<strong>Tropical</strong> divides the ecliptic into 12 equal 30° segments starting at the March equinox, aligning signs with seasons rather than today’s star positions.
